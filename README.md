# shiny.blueprint

A simple, but non-trivial example R web application based on shiny

* Different endpoints by a routing layer using a patched version of [shiny.router](https://github.com/Appsilon/shiny.router/pull/36)
* A database layer (In this example PostgreSQL, but you can easily switch to another system)
* A naive authentication system

### How to run app on your machine

First, edit the information you find in `.Renviron.example`, i.e. choose
a password, i.e. 12345, and store the new file as `.Renviron`, which will be git-ignored.

Then, run this command:

```shell
./run_local.sh
```
â€¦ and visit `localhost:3333` in your browser.

### Deployment (i.e. with heroku)

Create a heroku app and add it as git remote `heroku`. Use the default heroku stack `heroku-16`
and use the proper buildpack for your app by

```shell
heroku buildpacks:add http://github.com/virtualstaticvoid/heroku-buildpack-r.git#heroku-16
```

Afterwards `git push heroku master` is your friend!
